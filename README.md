# MoodleNet Web Client

This React project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
It has changed dramatically since its initial creation so the CRA documentation is no longer relevant and has been
removed from the README, however this notice is left here just in case it can be informative and for posterity.

## Deploying MoodleNet


### Install using Docker containers (recommended)

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a recent [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) (which supports v3 configs) installed:

```sh
$ docker version
Docker version 18.09.1-ce
$ docker-compose -v                                                                                                                                              
docker-compose version 1.23.2
...
```

2. Clone this repository and change into the directory:
```sh
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/moodlenet/clients/react.git
$ cd react
```

3. Configuration

First make sure to configure your domain name or subdomain to point to your server's IP address.

We need to set some environment variables in order for MoodleNet to function, a list of which can be found in these files:
- `.env` 
	- If you have a domain configured to point to your server, replace every instance of 'localhost' with 'your-domain-here.tld' and those of 'http:' with 'https:'  (the 's' is critical)
	- **If you want to connect your instance with the MoodleNet "mothership" for indexing public content, search, and discovery**, and you agree with the [Terms for Instance Administrators](https://moodle.net/terms/admins/index.html), set CONNECT_WITH_MOTHERSHIP to true, otherwise set it to false. You should then email moodlenet-moderators@moodle.com to request an API key. 
- `.env.secrets.example` (which you must copy to `.env.secrets`)
	- set each password and secret with something random and secure
	- MAIL_DOMAIN and MAIL_KEY are needed to configure transactional email, sign up at [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) and then configure the domain name and key 


4. Once configured, build the docker image:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

5. Try it out 

a) run the backend in console mode: `docker-compose run --rm backend bin/moodle_net start_iex`

b) add your email to the allowlist in order to be able to sign up: `MoodleNet.Access.create_register_email("myemail@domain.com")` and then exit (Ctrl+C and then `abort`)

c) Start the docker containers with docker-compose:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

6. The MoodleNet backend and frontend should now be running at [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) on your machine and at https://your-domain-name.tld/ with SSL certificates automatically configured thanks to letsencrypt.org (if your domain was correctly configured).

7. If that worked, start the app as a daemon next time:
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```


## Structure

### High level folder structure:

| Folder | Description |
|------|---|
| `/build` | the output directory containing static assets & application files |
| `/config` | contains all configuration for the build tooling, i.e. webpack |
| `/public` | files that will be copied into the `build` folder |
| `/scripts` | "run" files should be invoked via their respective `yarn` command |
| `/src` | the application source | 

### Application source folder structure:

**Please note that the project is undergoing some refactoring, and some of these may be changing...**

| Folder | Description |
|------|---|
| `/src/apollo` | all (react-)apollo boilerplate, type definitions, and resolvers |
| `/src/components` | all react components are stored here which are reusable, organised by type |
| `/src/containers` | high-level react container components which handle routing, state, and localisation set-up |
| `/src/graphql` | contains queries & (local state) mutation grapql query definitions |
| `/src/locales` | locale folders define the available locales (managed by linguijs) and each contains its locale's language data |
| `/src/pages` | user-facing application pages which are used in routing in the App container |
| `/src/static` | static assets such as images that are used within the application code (for example, images can be `require`'d with webpack) |
| `/src/styleguide` | contains files pertaining to react-styleguidist, such as a Wrapper component used to display all components in the styleguide within the Zen Garden theme provider |
| `/src/styles` | css files go in here, for styles that are not component-specific (i.e. not generated with `styled-component`) or for which a library relies on (e.g. flag icons) |
| `/src/themes` | the application Zen Garden theme set configuration and own theme files, with the `default.theme.ts` being the MoodleNet theme |
| `/src/types` | application typescript types, enums, & interfaces |

## Development Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn add-locale`

Adds a locale for localisation, with [lingui library](https://lingui.js.org/ref/react.html).<br>

### `yarn extract`

Extracts new/updated strings from the codebase into JSON files for localisation (they need to be encapsulated with [lingui library](https://lingui.js.org/ref/react.html)'s <Trans>).<br>

### `yarn compile`

Compiles localisation files for production.<br>

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

## Libraries

This section mentions notable libraries and tools used within the application and provides links to their documentation.

- React, UI framework (https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- TypeScript, programming language (https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- webpack, build tool (https://webpack.js.org)
- React Apollo, GraphQL client (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- Phoenix.js, Phoenix channels JS client (https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/js/index.html)

### Browser testing

We're using [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source) for testing the front-end in various browsers.
![BrowserStack](docs/assets/images/Browserstack-logo.svg)

## Localisation

[LinguiJS](https://lingui.js.org/) is the localisation library used for i18n.

### Set up

- LinguiJS is configured in the `.linguirc` file in the root of the application.

- It comes with a provider component that sets up i18n within the application and makes components
within the app able to consume the language strings of the user's chosen locale. The provider
is configured in the App container (`src/containers/App/App.tsx`).

- The app uses React 16 Context to manage the chosen locale and maintain a state around this.
The context (state) is also set up and handled within the aforementioned App container.

- Any component can "consume" the locale context by using the `LocaleContext` exported from the App 
container. This allows any component to access the API for changing the active locale. For example, 
the LanguageSelect component (`/src/components/inputs/LanguageSelect/LanguageSelect.tsx`) is wrapped
in the `LocaleContext.Consumer` component, giving it the `setLocale` function:

    ```jsx
      <LocaleContext.Consumer>
        {({ setLocale }) => (
          //...
        )})
      </LocaleContext.Consumer>
    ```

### Usage

Wherever you write visible text, i.e. anything user-facing, the copy should be written using the LinguiJS
components. The text used within the LinguiJS components can then be extracted using the CLI operations
provided by the library, which are detailed in the [Scripts](#scripts) section of this document.

Examples of using the LinguiJS library are given below.

#### Simple language strings

- First import the [`Trans` component](https://lingui.js.org/ref/react.html#trans):

    ```js
    import { Trans } from '@lingui/macro';
    ````
    
- _Note:_ the `Trans` component is imported from the `macro` package, not the `react` package! 

- Then consume the `Trans` component wherever text is used, like so:

    ```jsx
    <Trans>Sign in using your social media account</Trans>
    ```

#### Language strings as reference

- Import the [`i18nMark` function](https://lingui.js.org/ref/react.html#i18nmark).

    ```js
    import { i18nMark } from '@lingui/react';
    ```

- Define the language string however you like. It is usually the case that a file will contain more than one 
language string accessed via reference, in this case organise the strings within an object with properties
that describe their purpose. For example, from the Login page:

    ```js
    const tt = {
      //...
      validation: {
        email: i18nMark('The email field cannot be empty'),
        //...
      }
    }
    ````
    
- _Note:_ the `validation.email` string is wrapped in a call to `i18nMark`. As the string is not passed to (as props
or directly as children) to the `Trans` component it will not be picked up automatically by the LinguiJS extract
script. In order to "mark" the string as a language string to be included in the compiled language files we must
wrap it in a call to `i18nMark`.  

- Then consume the strings. Again, for example, from the Login page:
    
    ```jsx
    validation.push({
      field: ValidationField.email,
      type: ValidationType.error,
      message: tt.validation.email // <- notice the string reference here
    } as ValidationObject);
    ```
    
#### Plural language strings

LinguiJS has a `Plural` component, which is like the `Trans` component but used where the 
language contains pluralization.

> <Plural> component handles pluralization of words or phrases. 
> Selected plural form depends on active language and value props.

The LinguiJS documentation is very comprehensive and should be referred to for usage of the `Plural` component:

https://lingui.js.org/ref/react.html#plural

#### Interpolated language string

It is very common to interpolate values into language strings. This can be done using the `Trans` and `Plural` 
components, where the interpolated string names are denoted with curly braces (but still within the actual string) 
and the component is given a key/value hash via a `values` prop, where a key of the hash is the name of a string
to be interpolated. For example, from the Login page:

```jsx
<Trans
  id="You don't need an account to browse {site_name}."
  values={{ site_name: 'MoodleNet' }}
/>
```

It is possible then to have `site_name` or any other interpolated string value produced dynamically and inserted
during runtime. If interpolated values also require localisation then you would use a language string hash,
as above in [Language strings as reference](#language-strings-as-reference), making sure to use the `i18nMark`
function to mark them for extraction by the LinguiJS CLI.     

### Updating language files

Whenever updates are made to any language within the application you must run the LinguiJS `extract` script.
This will pull out all the language strings and add or update them in the specific locale messages files, which
live in `locales`.

All changes to the language within the application, including changes to the files within `locales`, should
be committed alongside other changes.
